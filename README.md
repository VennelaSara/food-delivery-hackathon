## 🚀 Key Insights
[📌 KEY BUSINESS INSIGHTS]
1️⃣ Order Trends & Seasonality

Orders show clear monthly variations, indicating seasonal demand patterns.
Peak order volumes are observed in specific months, suggesting opportunities for time-based promotions and capacity planning.

2️⃣ City-Wise Performance

Revenue is highly concentrated in a few cities, with top cities contributing a significant share of total platform revenue.
This indicates strong market dominance in metro regions and potential for expansion into under-penetrated cities.

3️⃣ Cuisine-Wise Performance

Certain cuisines consistently outperform others across regions, making them strong candidates for featured promotions and exclusive partnerships.
Lower-performing cuisines present opportunities for targeted marketing or menu optimization.

4️⃣ Membership Impact (Gold vs Regular)

Gold members contribute disproportionately higher revenue compared to Regular users.
Despite being fewer in number, Gold users place higher-value and more frequent orders, validating the effectiveness of the membership program.

5️⃣ Revenue Distribution

Revenue follows a skewed distribution where a small subset of users, cities, and cuisines generate a majority of platform earnings.
This aligns with the Pareto principle and highlights key focus areas for retention and monetization strategies.

🎯 BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS

Expand Gold membership incentives

Focus marketing spend on high-revenue cities

Promote top-performing cuisines during peak seasons

Introduce targeted campaigns for Regular users to convert them to Gold
